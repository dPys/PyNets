        thus will be subject to the payment of fees to the Licensor by any
        user of the Enterprise Derivative Work.

     Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in PyNets by You to

      origin of the Work.

  8. Disclaimer of Warranty.  Unless required by applicable law or agreed to
      in writing, the Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides

      OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation,
      any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY,
      or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. The Licensor makes clear that no
      condition is made or to be implied, nor is any warranty given or to be

      redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your
      exercise of permissions under this License.

      The Licensee agrees to indemnify the Licensor and hold the Licensor
      harmless from and against any and all claims, damages and liabilities
      asserted by third parties (including claims for negligence) which arise
      directly or indirectly from the use of the Software or the sale of any
      products based on the Software. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless
      required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts)
      or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for
      damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or
      consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this
      License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but
      not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer
      failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses),
      even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such
      damages.

  10. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability.  While redistributing Works or
      Derivative Works thereof, and without limiting your obligations under
      Section 6, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of
      support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights
      consistent with this License.  However, in accepting such obligations, You
      may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on
      behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold the Licensor and each other Contributor harmless for
      any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by
      reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

  13. General.

    (a) Relationship of Parties.  You and the Licensor are independent
        contractors, and nothing herein shall be deemed to constitute either
        party as the agent or representative of the other or both parties as
        joint venturers or partners for any purpose.

    (b) Export Control.  You shall comply with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt
        Practices Act and all applicable export laws, restrictions and
        regulations of the U.S. Department of Commerce, and any other applicable
        U.S. and foreign authority.

    (c) Assignment.  This Agreement and the rights and obligations herein may
        not be assigned or transferred, in whole or in part, by You without the
        prior written consent of the Licensor.  Any assignment in violation of
        this provision is void.  This Agreement shall be binding upon, and inure
        to the benefit of, the successors and permitted assigns of the parties.

    (d) Governing Law.  This Agreement shall be governed by and construed under

        to conflicts of laws provisions thereof, and without regard to the
        Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act.

    (e) Attorneys’ Fees.  In any action or proceeding to enforce rights under
        this Agreement, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its
        costs, expenses and attorneys’ fees.

    (f) Severability.  If any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid,
        illegal or unenforceable in any respect, that provision shall be limited
        or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that this Agreement
        otherwise remains in full force and effect and enforceable.

    (g) Entire Agreement; Waivers; Modification.  This Agreement constitutes the
        entire agreement between the parties relating to the subject matter
        hereof and supersedes all proposals, understandings, or discussions,
        whether written or oral, relating to the subject matter of this
        Agreement and all past dealing or industry custom. The failure of either
        party to enforce its rights under this Agreement at any time for any
        period shall not be construed as a waiver of such rights. No changes,
        modifications or waivers to this Agreement will be effective unless in
        writing and signed by both parties.
