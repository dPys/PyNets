About
-----
PyNets is a tool for sampling and analyzing varieties of individual structural and functional connectomes. Using decision-tree learning, along with extensive bagging and boosting, PyNets is the first application of its kind to facilitate fully-reproducible, parametric sampling of connectome ensembles from neuroimaging data. As a post-processing workflow, PyNets is intended for any preprocessed fMRI or dMRI data in native anatomical space such that it supports normative-referenced connectotyping at the individual-level. Towards these ends, it comprehensively integrates best-practice tractography and functional connectivity analysis methods based open-source libraries such as Dipy and Nilearn, though it is powered primarily through NetworkX and the Nipype workflow engine. PyNets can now also be deployed as a BIDS application, where it takes BIDS derivatives and makes BIDS derivatives.

Data already preprocessed with BIDS apps like fmriprep, CPAC, dmriprep? If your BIDS derivatives can be queried with pybids, then you should be able to run them with the user-friendly `pynets_bids` CLI!
```
   pynets_bids '/hnu/fMRIprep/fmriprep' '/Users/dPys/outputs/pynets' participant func --participant_label 0025427 0025428 --session_label 1 2 -config pynets/config/bids_config.json

```
*Note: If you preprocessed your BOLD data using fMRIprep, then you will need to have specified either `T1w` or `anat` in the list of fmriprep `--output-spaces`. Similarly, if you preprocessed your data using CPAC, then you will want to be sure that an ALFF image exists. PyNets does NOT currently accept template-normalized BOLD or DWI data. See the usage docs for more information on compatible file types.


where the `-config` flag specifies that path to a .json configuration spec that includes at least one of many possible connectome recipes to apply to your data. Pre-built configuration files are available (see: <https://github.com/dPys/PyNets/tree/master/pynets/config>), and an example is shown here (with commented descriptions):

```

    "func": { # fMRI options. If you only have functional (i.e. BOLD) data, set each of the `dwi` options to "None"
            "ct": "None", # Indicates the type(s) of clustering that will be used to generate a clustering-based parcellation. This should be left as "None" if no clustering will be performed, but can be included simultaneously with `-a`.

Data not in BIDS format and/or preprocessed using in-house tools?
No problem-- you can still run pynets manually:
```
    pynets -id '002_1' '/Users/dPys/outputs/pynets' \ # where `-id` is an arbitrary subject identifier and the first path is an arbitrary output directory to store derivatives of the workflow.
    -func '/Users/dPys/PyNets/tests/examples/sub-002/ses-1/func/BOLD_PREPROCESSED_IN_ANAT_NATIVE.nii.gz' \ # The fMRI BOLD image data.
    -anat '/Users/dPys/PyNets/tests/examples/sub-002/ses-1/anat/ANAT_PREPROCESSED_NATIVE.nii.gz' \ # The T1w anatomical image. This is mandatory -- PyNets requires a T1/T2-weighted anatomical image unless you are analyzing raw graphs that ahve already been produced.
    -a 'BrainnetomeAtlasFan2016' \ # An anatomical atlas name. Note that if were to omit the `-a` flag, a custom parcellation file would need to be specified using the `-a` flag instead or a valid clustering mask (`-cm`) would be needed to generate an individual parcellation. For a complete catalogue of anatomical atlases available in PyNets, see the `Usage` section of the documentation.
    -mod 'partcorr' \ # The connectivity model. In the case of structural connectometry, this becomes the diffusion model type.
    -thr 0.20 \ # Optionally apply a single proportional threshold to the generated graph.
```

```
    pynets -id '002_1' '/Users/dPys/outputs/pynets' \ # where `-id` is an arbitrary subject identifier and the first path is an arbitrary output directory to store derivatives of the workflow.
    -dwi '/Users/dPys/PyNets/tests/examples/sub-002/ses-1/dwi/DWI_PREPROCESSED_NATIVE.nii.gz' \ # The dMRI diffusion-weighted image data.
    -bval '/Users/dPys/PyNets/tests/examples/sub-002/ses-1/dwi/BVAL.bval' \ # The b-values.
    -bvec '/Users/dPys/PyNets/tests/examples/sub-002/ses-1/dwi/BVEC.bvec' \ # The b-vectors.
    -anat '/Users/dPys/PyNets/tests/examples/sub-002/ses-1/anat/ANAT_PREPROCESSED_NATIVE.nii.gz' \ # The T1w anatomical image.
    -a '/Users/dPys/.atlases/MyCustomParcellation-scale1.nii.gz' '/Users/dPys/.atlases/MyCustomParcellation-scale2.nii.gz' \ # The parcellations.
    -mod 'csd' 'csa' 'sfm' \ # The (diffusion) connectivity model(s).
    -dg 'prob' 'det'  \ # The tractography direction-getting method.
    -mst -min_thr 0.20 -max_thr 0.80 -step_thr 0.10 # Multi-thresholding from the Minimum-Spanning Tree, with AUC graph analysis.
