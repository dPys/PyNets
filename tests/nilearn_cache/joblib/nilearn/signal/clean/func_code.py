    """Improve SNR on masked fMRI signals.

    This function can do several things on the input signals, in
    the following order:

    - detrend
    - standardize
    - remove confounds
    - low- and high-pass filter

    Low-pass filtering improves specificity.

    High-pass filtering should be kept small, to keep some
    sensitivity.

    Filtering is only meaningful on evenly-sampled signals.

    Parameters
    ----------
    signals: numpy.ndarray
        Timeseries. Must have shape (instant number, features number).
        This array is not modified.

    sessions : numpy array, optional
        Add a session level to the cleaning process. Each session will be
        cleaned independently. Must be a 1D array of n_samples elements.

    confounds: numpy.ndarray, str or list of
        Confounds timeseries. Shape must be
        (instant number, confound number), or just (instant number,)
        The number of time instants in signals and confounds must be
        identical (i.e. signals.shape[0] == confounds.shape[0]).
        If a string is provided, it is assumed to be the name of a csv file
        containing signals as columns, with an optional one-line header.
        If a list is provided, all confounds are removed from the input
        signal, as if all were in the same array.

    t_r: float
        Repetition time, in second (sampling period).

    low_pass, high_pass: float
        Respectively low and high cutoff frequencies, in Hertz.

    detrend: bool
        If detrending should be applied on timeseries (before
        confound removal)

    standardize: bool
        If True, returned signals are set to unit variance.

    Returns
    -------
    cleaned_signals: numpy.ndarray
        Input signals, cleaned. Same shape as `signals`.

    Notes
    -----
    Confounds removal is based on a projection on the orthogonal
    of the signal space. See `Friston, K. J., A. P. Holmes,
    K. J. Worsley, J.-P. Poline, C. D. Frith, et R. S. J. Frackowiak.
